<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Bicycle Chain is a marketplace designed to allow individuals to sell their bicycles without having to be physically present during the transaction. 

The seller leaves their bicycle in a public location, locks it with a combination lock, and then posts the bicycle for sale on the marketplace. This creates a NFT of the bicycle with relevant information saved as metadata like the encrypted combination of the lock.

The buyer can then browse the available bicycles on the marketplace, find one they are interested in, go to the location of the bicycle, and make the purchase. The buyer will receive the NFT and thus the combination to the lock, allowing them to unlock and take possession of the bicycle.

This marketplace offers a convenient way for people to buy and sell bicycles, allowing for transactions to take place even when the seller and buyer are not in the same location.

### Why Bicycle Chain?

During my last holidy I wanted to rent a bicycle for two weeks, only to find out that it would cost almost as much as buying one. So I thought why not buying a bicycle and trying to sell it at the end of my holiday? But problem is that what do I do with the bicycle if I don't find a buyer and I also don't want the stress of searching a buyer during my holiday. This inspired the creation of **Bicycle Chain** which allows for transactions to take place even when the seller has left the bicycle.

I think a sharing economy is great because it can save resources. But how it works nowadays is that a company owns all these bicycles and lends them. They have the responsibility and ownership of these bicycles which allows them to make profits.

Bicycle Chain was created with the vision of promoting a true sharing economy, where individuals have ownership and the responsibility of the bicycle as long as they are using it.
